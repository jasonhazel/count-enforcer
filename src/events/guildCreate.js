I notice I'm missing some required permissions. Please ensure I have the following permissions:
${permissionNames.map(p => `- ${p}`).join('\n')}

You can grant these permissions by:
1. Going to Server Settings
2. Clicking on "Roles"
3. Finding my role
4. Enabling the missing permissions
5. Saving the changes

Once these permissions are granted, I'll be able to properly manage roles and interact with channels.`;

I've automatically created the "counter" role with the necessary permissions. This role will be automatically assigned to users when they register with the bot.

Important Note About Permissions:
- My role (${botRole.name}) needs to be above the "counter" role in the role hierarchy
- If you have existing roles that need to be managed by the bot, they should be below my role
- If you're using role-based permissions in your channels, make sure to adjust them to allow the "counter" role to access necessary channels
- The "counter" role has basic permissions (View Channel, Send Messages, Read Message History) to ensure users can interact with the bot

If you encounter any permission issues, please check:
1. My role's position in the role hierarchy
2. Channel-specific permission overwrites
3. That I have the "Manage Roles" permission enabled`;

I notice that the "counter" role is currently above my highest role. To ensure I can properly manage this role, please:

1. Go to Server Settings
2. Click on "Roles"
3. Drag my role (${botRole.name}) above the "counter" role
4. Save the changes

Important Note About Permissions:
- My role needs to be above any roles I need to manage
- If you have existing roles that need to be managed by the bot, they should be below my role
- If you're using role-based permissions in your channels, make sure to adjust them to allow the "counter" role to access necessary channels
